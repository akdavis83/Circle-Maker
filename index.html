           Creator is sovereign, powerful, almighty, and He looks down upon us constantly. When Israel went to take the Promised Land they said that they were as grasshoppers in the sight of the giants in the land but they missed the proper perspective because they were giants in the eyes of God because He had already given them the victory. By His power, by His might, by His omnipotence we are guided, kept safe, and led on until eternity. He sits in the heavens, He visits the earth, He is Lord of His creation, and He is waiting for you to fully yield to Him on a daily basis. When we put God in His proper place, and when we see and relate to each other in the proper perspective of God as first place, everything else falls into place because the word of God promises that it will be so.

          <h3>(2 Samuel 5:23)</h3>
          <p>23 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
            <br><br>
           Whenever the battle was on for David, he would enquire of the Lord and the Lord would give him supernatural strategies for victory. In this particular occasion, David was told to circle around behind the enemy to ambush and attack them. Joshua formulated a similar strategy against Ai when the Lord gave him the victory. Consult the Lord first in all things, and keep Him the closest in your circle of relationships.

          <h3>(Joshua 6:2-5)</h3>
          <p> 2 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour. 3 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. 4 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams’ horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. 5 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.
            <br><br><br>
           Marching orders from the Commander In Chief: circle the city one time for 6 days and circle the city 7 times for one day. The enemy saw the spectacle, they watched for six days wondering what in the world is happening? They didn't take any time to attack and they probably mocked what they saw occuring. At this point in time nations were starting to hear about the Lord and His victories, and some were starting to fear but Jericho stood securely and defiantly. It wasn't the method but the powerful God of Israel behind the method that made the foolishness effective. In essence this is the gospel message, the foolishness of preaching, the foolishness of obedience and righteousness directed by God bringing the walls down and bringing the victory in.

          <h3>Going In Circles?</h3>
          <p>
            The fear, doubt, and unbelief of the people caused them to go agaisnt God in a way He never intended, and this in turn caused them to go around in circles for forty years in the wilderness. Do not make the same mistake with your life eternal. Doubt no longer, fear no more what lies beyond, Christ extends His hand for salvation and His righteousness is available for all who will receive Him.
            <br><br>
           Jesus Christ is the way of salvation. He will never turn away anyone who goes to Him to receive Him in faith. Whatever you have done wrong in the past is not greater than what Christ Jesus has already done on your behalf. Romans 10:9-10 says that if you will believe in your heart, and confess with your mouth, Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, you shall be saved. He is mighty to save, heal, and deliver, and He delivers for eternal life with Him. Check out this site for more on salvation: <a href="https://akdavis83.github.io/Lost/">Salvation.</a>
